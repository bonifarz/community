#RaceMaps

As part of the Red Eclipse community repository, this place is shall serve as a collection of unofficial maps for the  -Race** game mode.


##Before submitting a map

Please check the following points before adding new maps to this collection.

* Does the map work with the current development version?
 - In particular: Does it have a **start checkpoint**?
* Does the map have a proper license in <mapname>.txt?
 - Does this license allow to share the map here (with proper attribution)?
* Is the map  -fun** to play? It does not have to be very polished, but it should add some value to the collection.
* Is another version or some derivative work of this map already available?
 - If so, do the maps differ in such a way that both are worth playing?
* Does the map have lighmaps?
 - If not, will it look better if you add some basic lighting?
* Are the file sizes reasonable?
 - In particular: Is the light precision reasonably coarse?
 - Are there garbage or duplicate lines in <mapname>.cfg? 
* Is it hard to find the way?
 - If so, what about adding some **route** entities?
